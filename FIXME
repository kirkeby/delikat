* Unique index on (user, url) in links.
* Implement private links by storing public and private links with
  different tags. And teach the worker about them.
* Need formvalidation - for instance only allow ASCII tags (or at-least
  not tags which overlap the system ones...)
* Need HTTPS and secure cookies.
